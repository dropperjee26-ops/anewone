 <p>  <p1 class="border"> Why can't monkeys speak? You might think it's because they've
got no larynx (voice box), wrong-shaped teeth, a different tongue,
and things like that. But as a matter of fact monkeys do have a
larynx. The big difference between a human larynx and a monkey
one is the position: we find it lower in humans than in monkeys.
So there's a lot of space above a human larynx. The result is that
human voices can give out a lot more sound. Humans probably
got their lower larynx through evolution. I mean they were a bit like
monkeys to start with, but slowly their larynx dropped down.
Maybe the biggest cause was the change from going round on four
legs to using just two. That pushed the head more forward and the
larynx lower. In my opinion, the price of this is pretty high. Yo–ø
won't hear monkeys speaking, but they don't easily get food stuck
their windpipe!</p1> </p>
